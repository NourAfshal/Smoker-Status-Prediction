# **Classifying Smokers vs Non Smokers**


**Objective:**

Our goal is not only to make accurate predictions but to achieve the best possible performance. In this project, we will build, evaluate, and improve our model using various techniques. In addition to linear regression with gradient descent, we will also apply AdaBoost and logistic regression to classify individuals as smokers or non-smokers, further enhancing the model's predictive capability.
